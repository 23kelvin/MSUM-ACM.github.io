        <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one
        show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that
        show to the people who make shows, and on the strength
        of that one show they decide if they're going to make
        more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
        television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She
        starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me
        some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace
        else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and
        there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find
        out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look
        at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go
        in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there,
        you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?  </p>

        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking
        fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
        I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you,
        I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it
        don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through
        too much shit this morning over this case to hand it
        over to your dumb ass.</p>
