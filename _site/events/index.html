        <p>What is Source Control and why would you every
use it? Come take this opportunity to learn
the concepts of source control, how to use it,
and learn of the benefits of using it. We will
be working primarily with Git, an open-source
distributed version control system that is used
widely by software professionals in their career.
Git also serves as the platform of the popular
service github.com that allows you to share
your programs all around the world. We even use
github.com to host our website!</p>

      <div class="event-page-description">
        <p>As computer scientists and technologists, we can do better than just making
code that works – we can make code that matters.  Diving through science
fiction, ubiquitous computing and a history of cloud technologies as we know
them, Alex will take the audience on a journey to discover the very heart of
why we code.  Alex Brandt is a Cloud Evangelist at Rackspace. Today he speaks
on behalf of Rackspace on a variety of topics. Previously his work focused on
training employees in Cloud, Python, Ruby, and Chef. He regularly consults with
Rackspace customers to develop unique solutions while internally developing new
approaches with evolving technologies. Alex holds a degree in Computer Science
and Physics from Minnesota State University, Moorhead</p>

        <p>The <em>Raspberry Pi</em> is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a
variety of interesting projects. In this workshop
you will be introduced to the Raspberry Pi, learn
about it’s many features and get pointers on how
to start your own Pi projects.</p>
