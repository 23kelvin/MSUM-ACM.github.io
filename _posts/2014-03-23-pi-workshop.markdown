The _Raspberry Pi_ is a credit-card sized computer that plugs into your TV and a
keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in electronics
projects (setting up a webserver), and for many of the things that your desktop
PC does, like spreadsheets, word-processing and games. It also plays
high-definition video. There are currently two models, Model A and Model B.
Many MSUM students have Raspberry Piâ€™s and use them for a variety of things.
This workshop you will be able to see what a Raspberry Pi is, how you can
purchase one, and the possibilities of a Raspberry Pi.
